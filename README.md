# BEAT: Asynchronous BFT Made Practical

- BEAT is an asynchronous Byzantine fault-tolerant protocol with high throughput and great scalability. 

- This repository contains a Python 2.7 implementation of the BEAT protocols. The prototype is built based on the implementation of HoneyBadgerBFT, another asynchronous BFT protocol https://github.com/amiller/HoneyBadgerBFT

- Currently, only BEAT0 has been released. Other BEAT protocols will be released soon.
